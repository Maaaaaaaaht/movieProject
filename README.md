# third-project

What's the project about? 

It's a display of a Wes Anderson movie list. And you can also submit your own movie data and randomize the order of the movies. 

What did I learn? 

I started using Javascript, and learnt how to use "for loops" as well as "functions". 
It was my first time to use a form and i learnt how user submit the form and how to return it to HTML. 
If i have more time i'd like to optimise the function that display the movie.
